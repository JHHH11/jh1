## Gatsby starter boilerplate 

This starter boilerplate gives you Gatsby configuration files that you can use to build your Gatsby website.

## How to use this boilerplate

1. **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the hello-world starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the the boilerplate
    gatsby new my-site https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-create-publish-static-serverless-website 
    ```

1. **Start development server.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-site/
    gatsby develop
    ```

    Your site will run at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Contents

| File/folder       | Description                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `.gitignore`      | Define what to ignore at commit time.      |
|`/node_modules`|This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.  |
|`/src`| This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”. |
|`.gitignore`   |This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.|
|`.prettierrc`|This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.|
|`gatsby-browser.js`|This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.|
|`gatsby-config.js`| This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail). |
|`gatsby-node.js`| This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.  |
|`gatsby-ssr.js` | This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering. |
|`package-lock.json`| (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project (you won’t change this file directly) |
| `README.md`       | A text file containing useful reference information about your project.                        |
| `LICENSE`         | Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.            |
